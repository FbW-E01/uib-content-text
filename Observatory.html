<h1>Fenton Hill Observatory</h1>

<p> <strong>Fenton Hill Observatory</strong>is an astronomical research facility operated by Los Alamos National Laboratory in the Jemez
    Mountains of New Mexico, about 35 miles (56 km) west of Los Alamos. The site is home to several astronomical
    experiments and observatories spanning 30 acres (120,000 m2).[1] It is also known as Technical Area 57 (TA-57) and
    is located at an elevation of 8,700 feet (2,700 m) in a region shielded from light pollution.[2] Los Alamos National
    Laboratory has a use agreement with the Forest Service for the 30 acres (120,000 m2), which is located near Fenton
    Lake State Park.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    A view of the observatory site in 1998
    The site was originally developed for a project in geothermal energy known as Hot Dry Rock, which was one of the
    first attempts at geothermal power. The project began in 1974 and was run intermittently until finally being
    terminated in 1995.[2] At that time the site was set to be turned back to the Forest service.

    A number of potential users of the site at Los Alamos met in late 1995 to propose making Fenton Hill into a research
    station for astronomy, geosciences, and educational outreach programs. A Fenton Hill Observatory steering committee
    was formed from Los Alamos staff and potential outside users. The Los Alamos branch of the University of California
    Institute for Nuclear and Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (INPAC) supported construction.

    Los Alamos has a history of pioneering research in gamma ray bursts. In 1973 the Vela satellite, which was built by
    Los Alamos to monitor atmospheric nuclear tests, recorded brief bursts of gamma-rays of cosmic origin coming from
    random directions on the sky. Today, theories abound on what causes the bursts and where they come from, but they
    remain a mysterious astronomical phenomena which is the subject of much research.[3] The REACT telescope was the
    first gamma-ray telescope built at Fenton Hill. It received funding in July 1996 and was completed in 1998.[1]

    Fenton Hill Observatory ran the Earthwatch Student Challenge Awards Program, funded by the Durfee Foundation, during
    which eight highly talented high school students came and used portable telescopes, CCD cameras and computers to
    determine some of the astronomical characteristics of the Fenton Hill site and other potential sites in the Jemez
    Mountains, such as Pajarito Peak. The program ran for five summers between 1997 and 2001.[1]Fenton Hill Observatory
